        Uses the data in seeds to enrich the contents of the database.

        @param seeding_round An int, designating the round fo seeding for which we seek the path.
                By default it is 0, so it returns a path to a folder called "SEED@T0". For some test cases that is the
                only seeding event in the lifecycle of the test, but other test cases require multiple phases where
                at each phase we need to simulate that the user has changed or added additional
                content to the database. In that case, the test harness pattern calls for multiple seeding events each of
                which will enrich the database at different times from data in different folders. For example,
                a folder "SEED@T0" would be used for an initial seeding at the start of the test,
                then "SEED@T1" for content that must be used to enrich the database in a subsequent phase 1, then
                "SEED@T2" for a subsequent phase 2, etc.
